# This example file contains configuration examples for how to set up the
# DAFO data service.
# To make use of custom local settings while launching the project from
# IntelliJ add the following to program arguments in the run configuration
# used to start the project:
#   --spring.config.location="classpath:/application.properties,file:$MODULE_DIR$/local_settings.properties"


# Define the port that the service will listen on
server.port = 443

# User database connection.
# This specifies the connection URL and credentials used to connect to the
# SQL Server database containing the user data administered in DAFO Admin.
# If integratedSecurity=true is specified in the URL windows will make use of
# the credentials used to launch the service, and it is not neccesary to
# specify username and password. If integratedsecurity is not used it will be
# neccessary to provide a username and password with access to the specified
# database.
# If the user database is not enabled, dummy userdata will be used instead of
# lookups in the database. This is mostly needed in the context of testing.

# Whitelisting of incoming connections: By IP, by client certificate DN and by DN of signing CA for the client
# certificate.
#
# This is used to whitelist who can connect to protected services. It follows the following rules:
# * Only IP adresses listed in ip.whitelist are allowed to connect.
#   This entry should contain the IP adresses of any forward-proxies that handles HTTPS termination and client
#   certificate validation for the service.
#   It is also a good idea to add local adresses (127.0.0.1 and IP of primary network interface) to allow debugging
#   non-restricted services from the server running the application.
# * Connections using a client certificate (eg. from Pitu) must have both their own DN and the DN of their
#   signing CA verified:
# ** Client certificates that does not have their DN in pitu.idn.whitelist will be blocked
# ** Client certificates that does not have the DN of their CA in pitu.sdn.whitelist will be blocked
#
# Each list is specified as a comma separated list of values.
